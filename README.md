# AbriellaSpeechAssistant

State of the art voice assistant

TODO, Use another conversational ai like bert or similar from https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index

DialoGPT is ok but needs fine tuning for conversation. 

Open AI is the best by far, but can be expensive to run. 


# Other areas

1. connect to db for journal/diary management
2. todo_list bug todolists.py but also needs connecting to db
3. some of the speech recognition does nothing or it doesn't get heard correctly so we need to tweak it
4. Film and book reccommendations to incorporate into speech functions from models in models directory
5. dataset for conversation.py needs deciding on as does the intents and or persona for chat
